        Hey there. I've owned this domain for years now, but I've put off
        posting anything here for all this time. So hey, poop or get off the
        pot, right?

        I make software. There are a lot of topics in that space that I think
        are interesting, and even more that I know too little about. I bounce
        between them all the time, but I've done a less than stellar job of
        documenting these adventures.

        So here we are!

        Computer graphics, game console architectures, artificial intelligence,
        bare-metal bit-twiddling, etcetera. I do not have interesting insights
        into these topics. But I do <em>find</em> them interesting. Maybe that
        will make the things I write interesting. Or not.
